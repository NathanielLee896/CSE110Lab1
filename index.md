## About Myself
Hi! My name is Nathan Lee and this is a page for you to get to know a little bit more about myself. I am from San Jose, California and I am in my fourth and hopefully final year at UCSD. I am pursuing **Math-CS** as my major. This Fall 2021, I am taking CSE 110 because I am pretty excited to be taking a course that it is more applicable to the workplace (*not to say that theory classes haven't been useful*) and I get the opporunity to work and create a project with some fellow classmates.

## Experience in Coding 
- ***Number of Years Coding***: 
  - 6 (2 at HS level, 4 at University level)
- ***Internships***: 
  - 12 - weeks at Amazon Web Services Lambda Department
- ***Projects***: 
  - Lambda Onboarding Tool
  - Amazon RabbitMQ 
  - Pomodoro Timer with Web Blocker
  - Pac-Man X Space Invaders (Here is a link to see my video presentation of this [game](https://bit.ly/2WdrkSv))

## Favorite Quotes to Motivate Me
- Alfred in Dark Knight: 
> Why do we fall sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up. 
- Thomas Edison: 
> "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." 
- Lance Armstrong: 
> "Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever." 
- Michael Scott:

## Top 3 Bugs that made me cry (Java Edition)
1. Extra Semicolons (This bug happened to me back in High School where I was stuck on this error for 2 whole days until my teacher looked at my code for 2 seconds and noticed the bug.)
```
System.out.println("Hello World!);;
```
2. Infinite Loops (This bug happened to me in CSE 11 when I was in the CS Dungeon and struggling to submit a PA as time was ticking down.)
```
while(true) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!);
}
```
3. Missing Java doc comment (*Check Style Error*) (This error kept showing up during my internship as I was trying to merely test parts of newly written code before deciding whether I needed it or not.)
```
public int thisMethodHasNoCommentsSMH(int num, int num2) {
    //some interesting code
}
```
